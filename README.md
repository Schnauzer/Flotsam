##Playing the Game

Simply download the game (extract it if necessary) and open the `flotsam.html` file in a browser.

The game has been tested with the latest version of Chome. Anything else might work, but is not officially endorsed/supported.

##Contributing

The game code is *really* messy, as it was written in 48 hours, but if you want to try, go for it.
